    git clone git://github.com/nprapps/copytext.git
    cd copytext
    mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages copytext
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python setup.py develop
    nosetests --with-coverage --cover-package=copytext

Usage
=====

Here is an example spreadsheet:

.. raw:: html
    
    <iframe width="600px" height="200px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10XiE39UYJ7aEMTlx3XVn9OoDPn4eFU4EiX6bIzgk3OA/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>

And here is code using this data:

::

    import copytext

    # Instantiate our copy, this parses the XLSX workbook
    copy = copytext.Copy('examples/test_copy.xlsx')

    # Get a sheet named "content"
    sheet = copy['content']

    # The sheet has "key" and "value" columns
    # This tells copytext to access the value by the key 

    # Print the value where the "key" is named "lorem_ipsum"
    print sheet['lorem_ipsum']

    # Print the value in the third row (counting headers)
    print sheet[2]

    # The rows themselves are also objects
    row = sheet['lorem_ipsum']
    
    # You can access the columns by indexing into the row

    # Print the key column of the row
    print row['key']

    # Print the first column in the row
    print row[0]

    # You can also iterate over rows
    for row in sheet:
        # Print the value
        print row

        # Print the key/value pair
        print row['key'], row['value']

    # This sheet has "term" and "definition" columns, but no "key"
    sheet = copy['example_list']

    # This won't work
    # print sheet[0]

    # But this will
    for row in sheet:
        print row['term'], row['definition']

    # You can have as many rows and columns as you want!

    # Serialize a sheet to json
    js = sheet.json()

    # Serialize an entire workbook to json
    js = copy.json()

.. note::

    Copytext only understands ``xlsx`` files, and all cells must be converted to text formatting. Copytext does not grok dates or numbers.

Using with Flask
================

Probably the most significant use case for copytext is as an input to a template system. For example, here is how you would use it with Flask's Jinja-based templates:

Your view::

    from flask import render_template

    import copytext

    @app.route('/')
    def index():
        context = {
            'COPY': copytext.Copy('examples/test_copy.xlsx')
        }

        return render_template('index.html', **context)

And in your template::

    <header>
        <h1>{{ COPY.content.header_title }}</h1>
        <h2>{{ COPY.content.lorem_ipsum }}</h2>
    </header>

    <dl>
        {% for row in COPY.example_list %}
        <dt>{{ row.term }}</dt><dd>{{ row.definition }}</dd>
        {% endfor %}
    </dl>

copytext automatically marks all strings as safe (``Markup`` in Jinja parlance).

.. note::

    Jinja templates automatically proxy attribute access to property access, which is why you see ``row.term`` instead of ``row['term']`` in these examples. This means you can also do ``row.0`` to access the first column.

Need a JSON version of your copytext for the client?

::

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var COPY = {{ COPY.json() }};
    </script>
